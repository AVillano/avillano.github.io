                <br> <br>Please report any bugs/criticisms/tips/comments to me using the email below. I know my game development, pixel art, and musical skills are currently 
                quite lacking, but I want to improve for the next project. Thank you.
                <br> <br>It's now been about six months since I completed this project, but it is better late than never with the retrospective. Going into the project,
                I had a very simple goal of simply completing something that I did all by myself. I didn't care about making it extremely complex or really anything crazy 
                at all. I had never used Unity before this project, so part of the process was just learning what I could do with the engine, and while I got a baseline understanding 
                of parts of it, there is still so much to learn. I spent two days in September starting to create the game and then didn't touch it for a while. 
                When December came around, I took the week leading up to Christmas off and said to myself that no matter what, I was going to get it done by Christmas. 
                Things were going smoothly up until, of course, the night of Christmas Eve. I was ready to create the executable file to share, and there were a bunch of issues 
                with the order in which things were being initialized. I knew this was a thing that could happen, but I had figured that if it was working in the Unity Editor, 
                things would be fine. This was not the case, so I started scrambling trying to at least get the game playable in the last few hours of the day. I started applying 
                what I assume were band-aid fixes to any object that crashed while trying to play and surely enough, the game was now in a state where it is playable. It is not really 
                fun to play, has horrible audio, as well as no ability to mute said audio, and in general is of questionable quality, but guess what, I do not care. 
                I had an idea and set out on the goal of making a game by myself, no matter how simple, and I achieved that goal in the time frame I gave myself. And that is all that matters to me.
